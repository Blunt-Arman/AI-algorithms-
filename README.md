a star algorithm

Implements the A* (A-star) search algorithm — an informed search technique that combines path cost and heuristic values to find the optimal route efficiently.
File Type: .py

ao star algorithm

Implements the AO* algorithm used in AND-OR graph problems where tasks can be decomposed into subproblems.
File Type: .py

alpha beta pruning

Demonstrates the Minimax algorithm optimized with Alpha-Beta Pruning for decision-making in adversarial games such as Tic-Tac-Toe or Chess.
File Type: .py

bfs algorithm

Implements the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm, which explores all nodes at the current depth level before moving deeper.
Useful for shortest-path and tree traversal problems.
File Type: .py

dfs algorithm

Implements the Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm, which explores nodes deeply before backtracking.
Commonly used in graph traversal and backtracking problems.
File Type: .py

mapcoloring

Solves the Map Coloring problem using constraint satisfaction techniques.
Ensures that adjacent regions are assigned different colors using backtracking or CSP logic.
File Type: .py
